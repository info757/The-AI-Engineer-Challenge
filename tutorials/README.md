# ðŸ“š AI Engineer Challenge Tutorials

This directory contains the learning materials and exercises that were completed as part of the AI Engineer Challenge journey.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Journey

### **Step 1: Understanding OpenAI API Basics**
- **File**: `Accessing_GPT_4_1_nano_Like_a_Developer.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Learn how to programmatically access GPT-4.1-nano using the OpenAI library
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Setting up API keys securely
  - Understanding different message roles (developer, assistant, user)
  - Creating chat completions
  - Helper functions for cleaner code
  - Chain of thought prompting

### **Step 2: Personal Experimentation**
- **File**: `my_new_notebook.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Apply learned concepts through personal experimentation
- **Key Activities**:
  - Testing different prompts and responses
  - Exploring system message variations
  - Understanding model behavior with different inputs
  - Building confidence with the API

### **Step 3: Development Environment Setup**
- **File**: `pyproject.toml`
- **Purpose**: Configure the Python development environment
- **Dependencies**: FastAPI, Jupyter, OpenAI, Pydantic, Uvicorn

## ðŸš€ From Tutorials to Application

The knowledge gained from these tutorials was then applied to build the full application:

1. **API Integration** â†’ Used in `api/app.py`
2. **System Messages** â†’ Implemented in frontend settings
3. **Error Handling** â†’ Applied throughout the application
4. **Best Practices** â†’ Followed in the final codebase

## ðŸ“– How to Use These Tutorials

### **For Learning:**
1. Start with `Accessing_GPT_4_1_nano_Like_a_Developer.ipynb`
2. Follow along with the exercises
3. Experiment with `my_new_notebook.ipynb`
4. Apply concepts to your own projects

### **For Reference:**
- Use these notebooks as reference for OpenAI API usage
- Check the helper functions for code examples
- Review the system message patterns
